## Project Overview


### High Rated Games on Google Playstore

#### Dataset used from :  [Google Play Store Apps] (https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps "Playstore Apps Store")
Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. Success of an app is largely determined by its ratings.

But is there any particular pattern among high rated apps? Does size or genre of the app play a role in determining its high rating?

Throughout this hands-on project,  I have put efforts to have insights on some interesting statistics!!!
